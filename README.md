# ionic-firebase-auth
Ionic V1 Starter template for Firebase Auth flow, from signup to password reset :)

This is an Ionic Framework starter template, all you need to do is run:
'ionic start myAppName https://github.com/javebratt/ionic-firebase-auth/'

This will give you a complete auth module built to work with Firebase

**This is V1.0.0**

It gives you everything modularized following John Papa's angular code style

**TODO**
Add form validation with ngMessages
